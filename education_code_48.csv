Sec. 48.266.,DISTRIBUTION OF FOUNDATION SCHOOL FUND,"(a) For each school year the commissioner shall determine:(1) the amount of money to which a school district is entitled under Subchapters B, C, and D;(2) the amount of money to which a school district is entitled under Subchapter E;(3) the amount of money allocated to the district from the available school fund;(4) the amount of each district's tier one local share under Section 48.256; and(5) the amount of each district's tier two local share under Section 48.202 for:(A) the district's maintenance and operations tax effort described by Section 48.202(a-1)(1); and(B) the district's maintenance and operations tax effort described by Section 48.202(a-1)(2).(b) Except as provided by this subsection and subject to Subsection (b-1), the commissioner shall base the determinations under Subsection (a) on the estimates provided to the legislature under Section 48.269, or, if the General Appropriations Act provides estimates for that purpose, on the estimates provided under that Act, for each school district for each school year. The commissioner shall reduce the entitlement of each district that has a final taxable value of property for the second year of a state fiscal biennium that is higher than the estimate under Section 48.269 or the General Appropriations Act, as applicable. A reduction under this subsection may not reduce the district's entitlement below the amount to which it is entitled at its actual taxable value of property.(b-1) Periodically throughout the school year, the commissioner shall adjust the determinations made under Subsection (a) to reflect current school year estimates of a district's enrollment and average daily attendance, based on attendance reporting for each six-week interval.(c) Each school district is entitled to an amount equal to the difference for that district between the sum of Subsections (a)(1) and (a)(2) and the sum of Subsections (a)(3), (a)(4), and (a)(5).(d) The commissioner shall approve warrants to each school district equaling the amount of its entitlement except as provided by this section. Warrants for all money expended according to this chapter shall be approved and transmitted to treasurers or depositories of school districts in the same manner that warrants for state payments are transmitted. The total amount of the warrants issued under this section may not exceed the total amount appropriated for Foundation School Program purposes for that fiscal year.(e) If a school district demonstrates to the satisfaction of the commissioner that the estimate of the district's tax rate, student enrollment, or taxable value of property used in determining the amount of state funds to which the district is entitled are so inaccurate as to result in undue financial hardship to the district, the commissioner may adjust funding to that district in that school year to the extent that funds are available for that year.(f) If the amount appropriated for the Foundation School Program for the second year of a state fiscal biennium is less than the amount to which school districts and open-enrollment charter schools are entitled for that year, the commissioner shall certify the amount of the difference to the Legislative Budget Board not later than January 1 of the second year of the state fiscal biennium. The Legislative Budget Board shall propose to the legislature that the certified amount be transferred to the foundation school fund from the economic stabilization fund and appropriated for the purpose of increases in allocations under this subsection. If the legislature fails during the regular session to enact the proposed transfer and appropriation and there are not funds available under Subsection (h), the commissioner shall adjust the total amounts due to each school district and open-enrollment charter school under this chapter and the total amounts necessary for each school district to comply with the requirements of Chapter 49 by an amount determined by applying to each district and school the same percentage adjustment to the total amount of state and local revenue due to the district or school under this chapter and Chapter 49 so that the total amount of the adjustment to all districts and schools results in an amount equal to the total adjustment necessary. The following fiscal year:(1) a district's or school's entitlement under this section is increased by an amount equal to the adjustment made under this subsection; and(2) the amount necessary for a district to comply with the requirements of Chapter 49 is reduced by an amount necessary to ensure a district's full recovery of the adjustment made under this subsection.(g) Not later than March 1 each year, the commissioner shall determine the actual amount of state funds to which each school district is entitled under the allocation formulas in this chapter for the current school year and shall compare that amount with the amount of the warrants issued to each district for that year. If the amount of the warrants differs from the amount to which a district is entitled because of variations in the district's tax rate, student enrollment, or taxable value of property, the commissioner shall adjust the district's entitlement for the next fiscal year accordingly.(h) The legislature may appropriate funds necessary for increases under Subsection (g) from funds that the comptroller, at any time during the fiscal year, finds are available.(i) The commissioner shall compute for each school district the total amount by which the district's allocation of state funds is increased or reduced under Subsection (g) and shall certify that amount to the district.
